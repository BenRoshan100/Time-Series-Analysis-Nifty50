## Overview
The project revolves around analysing the the closing price and Volume-weighted average price of Reliance's stock changes in time. It starts with preparing the data for visualizations and goes on with an extensive exploratory data analysis which also includes the impact of Reliance stocks due to COVID-19 and followed by time series model building and using the new tool Prophet for time series forecasting released by Facebook

## Motivation
I have barely worked with time dataset besides being a curical form of data in the field of data science. This time I explored a lot of unique concepts by understanding the math behind ARIMA and stationarity concepts. I got a chance to with with fb prophet which is a new library for forecasting and it was pretty challenging and exciting to work on new concepts 

## Objectives of project
1. Data Preparation
2. Data Visualization
3. Building a time series model
